AI Assistant Platform (DeepSeek-Inspired)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a custom-built AI assistant platform inspired by modern LLM-based systems like DeepSeek. It provides an interactive chat interface backed by a large language model, designed for intelligent conversation, code assistance, and task automation. The goal is to build an open, modular alternative that demonstrates how an end-to-end AI assistant can be developed and deployed.
